# Local Fast Whisper Integration

## Overview

The wake word integration example now supports using a local Fast Whisper endpoint for Stage 2 confirmation, in addition to the Replicate API.

## Configuration

Set one of these environment variables:

### Option 1: Local Fast Whisper (Recommended for low latency)

```bash
# In .env file or environment
WHISPER_ENDPOINT=http://tc3.local:8085
```

### Option 2: Replicate API (Cloud-based)

```bash
# In .env file or environment
REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_replicate_api_key_here
```

## Local Fast Whisper Endpoint Specification

The integration expects a local endpoint with this API:

**POST /transcribe**

Accepts:
- `multipart/form-data` with a `file` field containing the audio file
- OR `application/json` with base64 encoded audio

Returns:
```json
{
  "text": "transcribed text here",
  "duration_s": 1.23
}
```

### Example Local Whisper Server

Based on the provided OpenAPI spec, your server at `http://tc3.local:8085` implements:

- `/transcribe` - POST endpoint for audio transcription
- `/health` - GET endpoint for health checks

This is compatible with the integration.

## Usage

```bash
# Set your endpoint
echo "WHISPER_ENDPOINT=http://tc3.local:8085" >> .env

# Run the integrated example
cargo run --example wake_word_integration
```

## How It Works

1. **Stage 1**: Local MFCC+DTW pattern matching detects potential wake word
   - Low latency: < 1ms per frame
   - Runs continuously on your machine
   - ~75-85% detection rate

2. **Stage 2**: Audio is sent to Fast Whisper for confirmation
   - Captures 2-second audio segment
   - Sends to configured endpoint (local or Replicate)
   - Verifies "computer" appears in transcription
   - Overall accuracy: 90-95%

## Benefits of Local Whisper

Compared to Replicate API:
- ✅ Lower latency (local network vs internet)
- ✅ No API costs
- ✅ Privacy (audio stays on your network)
- ✅ No internet dependency
- ✅ Faster Stage 2 confirmation

## Troubleshooting

### Connection refused
- Check that your Fast Whisper server is running
- Verify the endpoint URL is correct
- Test with: `curl http://tc3.local:8085/health`

### Transcription errors
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify audio format is supported (WAV, 16-bit PCM)
- Ensure server has enough resources

### False positives/negatives
- Adjust detection threshold in code (default: 0.65)
- Lower threshold = more sensitive, more false positives
- Higher threshold = less sensitive, more missed detections
- Stage 2 confirmation filters most false positives

## Performance

Typical latency breakdown:
- Stage 1 detection: < 500ms
- Stage 2 with local Whisper: ~100-300ms
- Stage 2 with Replicate: ~1-3 seconds

Total response time with local Whisper: **~600ms - 800ms**
